FLEXI SYNTH 1.0


Welcome to Flexi Synth. To get started select a wave type from one of the oscillator drop down menus, set a frequency, a long with an envelope setting of choice and increase the output volume.
Press the green 'play' button at the top to hear your sounds.
From here any other parameter you wish to set is entirely up to you.

In order to succeed with frequency modulation from within the matrix window, be sure that a source and destination has been chosen, an lfo wave type selected from either one of the two lfos and start modulating by turning the mod freq wheel.

To return settings to factory, click the default button in the far right.
Loading and and saving presets can be achieved next to the default button.
Just find a sound you like and save it into the presets folder and all settings are saved for good.

Pre-made presets can be found in the presets folder if you want to hear demos.

Thanks and enjoy Flexi Synth!
